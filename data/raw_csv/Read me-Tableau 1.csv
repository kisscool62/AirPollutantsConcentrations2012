"In the ""station_statistics"" sheets, you can find the following information:";;;;
;;;;
;* Metainfomation on the stations (code, type…);;;
;* Information on the corresponding pollutants (code, name, units …);;;
;* Total population in the city where the station is located;;;
;* The population assigned to this station every year (it depends on the number of stations of the same type in that city in that year;;;
;and on the percentage of people living close to traffic sources for that city/country);;;
;;;;
according to the following codes:;;;;
;;;;
;station_european_code: code of the station;;;
;"type_of_station: it can be ""traffic"" or ""background"", depending on the dominant source";;;
